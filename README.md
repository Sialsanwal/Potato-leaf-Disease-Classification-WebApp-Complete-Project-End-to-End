# Project Overview
Potato crops are susceptible to various diseases that can impact yield and quality. This project aims to provide an automated solution for identifying these diseases through image classification. The classification model is trained on a dataset of potato leaf images representing healthy leaves and various disease conditions.
# Features
- Preprocessing: The project includes preprocessing steps such as image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance the model's performance.

- Machine Learning Model: The image classification model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. It's trained on labeled images to accurately classify different diseases.

- Web Application: The web app allows users to upload potato leaf images and receive predictions about the presence of diseases. It provides a user-friendly interface for real-time classification.
# Technologies Used
- **Python:** Used for data preprocessing, model training, and web app development.

- **TensorFlow and Keras:** Used to create, train, and evaluate the deep learning model.

- **Flask:** Used to develop the web application and handle user interactions.

- **Next.js:** Used for designing the web app's user interface.
